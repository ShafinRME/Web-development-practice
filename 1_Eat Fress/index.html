            <h1>My recipies</h1>
            <p>Food recipes, also known as culinary recipes, are detailed instructions that guide you in preparing a
                specific dish or meal. They provide a step-by-step process, including a list of ingredients and specific
                measurements, cooking techniques, and suggested cooking times and temperatures. Recipes are used as a
                blueprint to recreate a particular dish, ensuring consistency and accuracy in flavors and presentation.

                <h2>Sloppy Joes</h2>
                <p>If you're craving a reliable, nostalgic, easy (and cheap) weeknight dinner, then there's no debate: A
                    sloppy Joes' night is in order. The perfect answer to, “How far can I stretch this package of ground
                    beef?” sloppy Joes only require a handful of simple ingredients (that you most likely already have
                    on hand) to create a classic family dinner. Our tried-and-tested recipe uses the unstoppable sloppy
                    Joes trio—ground beef, tomato flavors, and onion—to create a flavor-packed meal that's for way more
                    than just sandwiches</p>

                <h2>BBQ Chicken Pizza</h2>
                <p>Step aside, basic pepperoni—this BBQ chicken recipe is our new pizza go-to. While there are plenty of
                    delicious versions of this now-classic pizza (CPK's BBQ chicken pizza is so iconic we made our own
                    copycat recipe), we believe ours truly has it all: sweet BBQ sauce, tangy gouda, creamy mozzarella,
                    and a hefty dose of red onions and cilantro for freshness.</p>
